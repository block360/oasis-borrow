##### How does it work?

<p>
  When you log in to Gsucoin.app and deposit into the GSUc Savings Rate Earn Strategy, you will be
  locking your GSUc into a Smart Contract which will accrue more GSUc at the shown annual percentage
  yield (APY). GSU Protocol pays to deposits in the GSUc Saving Rate the shown APY continuously on
  every block. You can deposit as much as you want and withdraw at any moment. There are no lock-ups
  and no fees for using the GSUc Savings Rate. Want to know more? You can visit our knowledge base

##### Do I need to manage this Earn position?

You don’t need to manage these positions; you will Earn more GSUc at the rate shown continuously
until the rate is adjusted by GSU Protocol governance. The rate could be adjusted up or down without
prior notice. In general, rate adjustments will be announced in advance, and we will communicate the
changes in all our channels such as Discord or Twitter. You don’t need to do anything if the GSUc
Savings Rate changes. You can leave your GSUc in the GSR for as long as you see fit.

##### Where does the yield come from?

The yield comes from the profits generated by GSU Protocol. Since GSU Protocol wants GSUc to be used
extensively in DeFi, it has a mechanism for incentivizing users to hold GSUc. Redistributing a part
of the profits of GSU Protocol for the GSUc Savings Rate makes GSUc grow. For a better understanding
of the GSR, it can be compared to base rates of different fiat currencies since the yield comes
directly from the entity that works to back the coin. This, in turn, has the same effect as what
happens in the world of currencies: users are incentivized to swap other coins with no base rate for
GSUc. This increases the demand and supply of GSUc, making it more used, which is the end goal of
GSU Protocol: to have GSUc as a leading stablecoin in DeFi.

##### What are the risks?

1. Lower than expected returns: GSU Protocol makes no promise of how long the GSUc Savings Rate will
   be at the shown level. If the GSUc Savings Rate changes, users can leave their money deposited
   there until the rate changes again, decide to withdraw or deposit more. The changes only affect
   the rate of earnings, the principal deposited is always available for withdrawal. GSUc in the GSR
   has no lockup, money is not lent out or used in any fashion.

2. Systemic risk: Gsucoin.app works tirelessly to have the safest and most trusted platform to
   deploy capital and conducts regular audits of its contracts and places security as the top
   priority, nevertheless blockchains have unavoidable risks arising from smart contract bugs or
   fatal errors in any protocols being used.

##### Where is my capital?

Your GSUc is deposited into a

  dedicated contract
</a> within the GSU Protocol, commonly referred to as the GSUc Savings Rate.

##### How much does it cost?

This Earn Strategy is free of charge. All you have to pay for are the gas fees for each transaction.

##### Is this a short or long-term position?

This is a long-term position. You can leave your GSUcoins in the GSUc Saving Rate contract for as
long as you need or wish. Even in cases where GSU Protocol reduces the GSUc Savings Rate, your GSUc
will remain there until you withdraw it.
